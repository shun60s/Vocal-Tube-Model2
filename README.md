# vocal tract tube model 2   

Python Class to calculate frequecny response and process reflection transmission of resonance tube.  
There are two, three, four, and five tube model.  

## tube model check of frequency response    

Comparison computed frequency response to white noise input frequency response using FFT analysis.  

```
python tubecheck.py
```
